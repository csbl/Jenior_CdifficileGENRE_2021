# Genome-scale metabolic network analysis of the bacterial pathogen *Clostridioides difficile* highlights conserved patterns of virulence-related core metabolic reprogramming

### Abstract

*Clostridioides difficile* is a Gram-positive, sporulating anaerobe that has become the leading cause of hospital-acquired infection. Over the previous decade, numerous studies have brought the importance of metabolism to numerous aspects of *C. difficile* infection and pathogenesis to the forefront. Additionally, due to growing threats of antibiotic resistance and recurrent infection, targeting components of metabolism presents another possible means by which to combat this infection. In the past, genome-scale metabolic network analysis of bacteria has afforded the ability to systematically investigate how genetic and metabolic properties potentially contribute to observed phenotypes and predict the outcome of perturbations. These predictions ultimately create a platform for high-throughput identification and screening of potential therapeutic targets prior to laboratory testing. To accomplish these goals in *C. difficile*, we constructed highly-curated metabolic network reconstructions for a well-studied laboratory strain of the pathogen (str. 630) as well as a more recently characterized hyper-virulent isolate (str. R20291). These GENREs include key components of its core metabolism and nutrient acquisition systems to recapitulate metabolic behaviors within the complex milieu of the gut. Simulating the impact of single-gene deletions revealed accuracies of 89.1% and 88.9% for each GENRE respectively compared with transposon mutant libraries. Further analysis of both strains also revealed significant correlations between in silico and experimentally measured growth in carbon source utilization screens (p-values â‰¤ 0.002). Subsequently, in vitro and in vivo transcriptomic data integration with each GENRE predicted shifts in carbohydrate & amino acid metabolism which corresponded with differential virulence factor expression experimentally. Collectively, our results indicated that GENRE-based analyses of *C. difficile* are an effective means for understanding metabolism during infection and novel therapeutic target identification.
